# Password-Generator-Application

## What is the project
- This simple project that helps me learn more about application development and how GUI development works in Python 3.
- The GUI frameworks I used were Tkinter, PyQt, and PySide. I was familiariing myself how to create labels, buttons, and a windows.
- I also did some things with application development that taught me things such as structure, modular design, user interatctions,
event handling, and integrations.
- I also created this project because I want to secure accounts I make and having this application will eliminate the need
of thinking of a password.

## How to use
- You will need to install PyInstaller by using `pip install pyinstaller` on the terminal
- Use `pyinstaller --onefile password_gen_desktop.py` on the terminal
- The application will be made on a dist directory which you can find in the same area you have the python file.
